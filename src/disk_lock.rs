//! This module defines a [DiskLock] trait for locking disk access. This trait is primarily employed
//! to enable support for custom lock strategies, such as fluxfox-egui's `TrackingLock` which is
//! used to track disk access across that application's various tools.
//!
//! The concept of a [DiskLock] is that it can be supplied with a [LockContext] trait implementor
//! which allows the tracking and querying of what has the disk image locked. This is useful for
//! debugging lock contention issues.
