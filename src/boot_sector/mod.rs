    src/boot_sector/mod.rs

    Routines for reading and modifying boot sector data - specifically the
    BIOS Parameter block.

    When creating disk images with a supplied boot sector template, we must
    be able to patch the BPB values as appropriate for the specified floppy
    image format, or the disk will not be bootable.
