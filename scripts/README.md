# fluxfox - utility scripts

Here I will keep some miscellaneous Python scripts I found useful during development. Some of them involve automation
of fluxfox utilities, or otherwise preprocess disk images in ways not natively supported by library functionality.

## kryoflux_delete_odd_tracks.py

Remove odd tracks from a Kryoflux disk set and renumber the remaining tracks sequentially.
This is useful for processing 48tpi disks that were dumped in 96tpi drives without the proper step parameter.
