# imgviz style definition
#
# This file defines the desired style settings for the rendered image.
# Color definitions can be an array of 4 values: [r, g, b, a], or a hexadecimal value in the form 0xRRGGBBAA.
# `Stroke` must be a floating-point value. Include the decimal point!

# Default Style Settings
[default_style]
fill = [128, 128, 128, 255]   # Default gray fill
stroke = [0, 0, 0, 0]         # Default transparent stroke. Stroke is not very useful as the disk is split into 
                              # quadrants to avoid rendering issues, but hey, it's here if you want to see it.
stroke_width = 0.0            # Default stroke width (none)

# Mask style definitions.
[masks]
weak = [0, 0, 255, 255]        # Weak mask color (blue)
error = [255, 0, 0, 255]       # Error mask color (red)

# A vector for a track is only drawn if it has nonzero alpha fill.
# Specifying a full-alpha fill color will hide the data layer. This is mostly useful if only rendering metadata,
# and you want to see the full track ring.
[track_style]
fill = [128, 128, 128, 255]    # Default gray fill

# Element style definitions.
# An element will inherit the default style settings unless overridden here.
# A full element definition takes the form:
# ElementName = { fill = [r, g, b, a], stroke = [r, g, b, a], stroke_width = 1 }
#
# The following elements are defined:
# - Marker: A marker element, such as an IAM, IDAM or DAM marker on an MFM track.
# - SectorHeader: A sector header element - not all track schemas will have these.
# - SectorBadHeader - A bad sector header element - same as above, but with a failed CRC/checksum.
# - SectorData - A sector data element.
# - SectorBadData - A bad sector data element - same as above, but with a failed CRC/checksum.
# - SectorDeletedData - A `deleted` sector data element. Only applicable to some track schemas (System34).
# - SectorBadDeletedData - A bad `deleted` sector data element. Same as above, but with a failed CRC/checksum.
