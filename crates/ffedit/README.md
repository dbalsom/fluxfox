# ffedit: the fluxfox editor

This is a TUI application powered by [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) that enables operations on a disk image, powered by
fluxfox.

ffedit is not in a usable state yet. This is a placeholder README that will eventually contain usage instructions when
ffedit is actually ready for use.
